## What’s the Open Letter tool?

Fix The Status Quo’s new Open Letter engagement tool enables digital campaigners to build coalitions, garner support, and leverage pressure to win their campaigns. 

Have a campaign demand or open call that you want to get public endorsement for? Or a joint statement that you want to display prominently on your campaign page with the list of signatories? This easy widget tool allows you to do just that without having to create a brand new web page.

##How is it different from other tools out there?
1. Easy to integrate with your existing campaign page 
2. Data encryption and privacy for everyone who signs up to endorse your open call
3. Sign on with your organisation’s Twitter handle to leverage pressure on social media
4. Display all signatories prominently on your webpage or campaign page 

## How do I use it? 

1. Work with your campaigns team and partner organisations to finalise your open letter content. Once you have that ready, create a new page on your existing website, the way you usually do. 

2. Now that you have the text, how do you get partner organisations, members of parliament and values-aligned collectives to endorse your call? Use our html code to add the Sign Up form onto your existing page. 

3. Fill in your organisation’s Twitter handle and the in-built code will do the rest: it will pull your organisation name, logo, email and other relevant details to auto-fill the form. 

4. Customise the Sign-Up form layout to match your organisation’s branding guidelines. 

5. Once you’ve signed, SHARE across all social media platforms! You can also display the list of signatories with their Twitter handles directly on your campaign page. No more google forms with shady data privacy and unintuitive display features.

Like petition but
- can sign as an organisation or individual
- can have moderation/approval workflow for one or the other
- need a display of the result (and offer the option to filter by country?) and/or as a choropleth?

How it's done "usually"

During the preparation phase, shared google sheet for signatories, google form for the most advanced

Once launched: open letter + list of signatories, usually as bullet points with their names

No option or clear workflow to sign post launch for more VIPs or new NGOs

No option for "normal" people to sign
